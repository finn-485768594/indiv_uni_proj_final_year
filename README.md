about the knee MRI.  link: https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/ (make sure to reference in work)
^^^ raw k-space data in several sub-dataset groups. Curation of these data are part of an IRB approved study.
Data from more than 1,500 fully sampled knee MRIs obtained on 3 and 1.5 Tesla magnets and DICOM images from 10,000 clinical knee MRIs also obtained at 3 or 1.5 Tesla. The raw dataset includes coronal proton density-weighted images with and without fat suppression. The DICOM dataset contains coronal proton density-weighted with and without fat suppression, axial proton density-weighted with fat suppression, sagittal proton density, and sagittal T2-weighted with fat suppression. The exact distribution of contrasts is given in table 1. Please note that this table does not include stats about the data that was originally held back for the fastMRI reconstruction challenge.

Field Strength	
PD	697
PD with fat suppression	701
Total	1398
